# Bootcamp Day 2: 17.August.2022

1) Ask user to input two numbers, compare them and output result:
   Input:
       Enter value a: 10
       Enter value b: 10
   Expected output:
       is 10 equal to 10? - true
       is 10 less than 10? - false
       is 10 less or equal to 10? - true
       is 10 greater than 10? - false
       is 10 greater or equal to 10? - true

2) Ask user to input two boolean values and compare them.
    Input:
       Enter b1: true
       Enter b2: false
    Expected output:
       Is b1 and b2 equal? - false

3) Ask user to input a whole number and output true, if it is even number and false if it is odd number
    Hint: use remainder operator to divide number by two and get reminder (if reminder is 0 then it means it is even number)-
4) Ask user to input a whole number and output false, if it is even number and true if it is odd number

5) Write a program which reads boolean value from user and prints out the opposite value:
    Example input:
        Enter boolean value: true
    Expected output:
        Opposite of "true" is "false"
6) Write a program which asks the user to input two whole numbers a and b. Output "true", if one of this condition is true:
    1) a and b is equal
    2) a is less than 0 and b is greater than 0
    3) both of them are greater than 100
    otherwise output "false":
    Examples:
        a is -1 and b is -2 -> false
        a is -2 and b is 1 -> true
        a is -1 and b is -1 -> true
        a is 101 and b is 102 -> true
        a is 99 and b is 200 -> false
